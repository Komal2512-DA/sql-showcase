When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the employees table, but the reporters still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.

Result:
-Return the column 'employee_id'
-Return the result ordered by employee_id in ascending order.

employees
| employee_id  | name      | manager_id  | salary |
| ------------ | --------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 1            | Luis      | 2           | 14384  |
| 2            | Den       | NULL        | 12208  |
| 3            | Alexander | NULL        | 9970   |
| 4            | Shelli    | 3           | 6943   |
| 5            | Sigal     | 6           | 5564   |
| 7            | Guy       | 6           | 8120   |


Approach : 
- Self Join action will be performed because relationship exist in the same table between emp and mgr. 
- Retain employee table to make sure all the manager who left as well can be retained to compare with another table .
- Filter where emp has less than 15k and filter where manager has left the company . 
- For the above scenario , we will check a mgr is not present in the mgr table and and presents in the emp table .
- Then retrieve the info of emp of that particular emp after filtering .
- Sort the output.

Solution : 

SELECT e.employee_id
FROM employees e 
LEFT JOIN employees m 
ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id
WHERE e.salary < 15000 AND e.manager_id IS NOT NULL AND m.employee_id IS NULL
ORDER BY 1 ;
