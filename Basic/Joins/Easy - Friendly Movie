| ------------------------ | ------- |                                                      | --------------------------- | -------- |
| `content_id`             | INT     |                                                      | `program_date`              | DATETIME |
| `title`                  | VARCHAR |                                                      | `content_id`                | INT      |

-- I came across a similar problem on Scaler!

Approach : 
- There are three filters on which i have to focus 
  first , it should be kids_content , program date should be of June 2020 and content type should be movies
- First step is to do inner join then filter on such scenarios , and retrieve the kids friendly movies title .

Solution : 

SELECT DISTINCT title
FROM Content c
INNER JOIN TVProgram tv 
ON c.content_id = tv.content_id 
WHERE Kids_content = 'Y' AND content_type = 'Movies' and
     date_format(program_date, "%Y-%m-%d") BETWEEN '2020-06-01' AND '2020-06-30' 
ORDER BY 1;
