Problem : 
You're given two tables: CITY and COUNTRY. Each city in the CITY table has a reference to a country using the CountryCode, which corresponds to the Code field in the COUNTRY table.
Your task is to write a SQL query that calculates the total population of all cities that are located in countries within the continent of 'Asia'.

-- This query is based on a problem from HackerRank's SQL domain.

Approach :
- Join both tables on commeon key to find out the sum of population of cities where continent is asia and continent is available in the country table.

Solution : 
SELECT SUM(c.population) AS total_population
FROM city c 
INNER JOIN country ct 
ON c.countrycode = ct.code
WHERE continent = 'Asia';
