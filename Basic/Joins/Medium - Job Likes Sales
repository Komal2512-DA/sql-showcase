Problem Statement:
-Display the details of the employees who had job titles like 'sales' in the past and the min_salary is greater than or equal to 6000.

Result:
-Return the columns 'employee_id', 'department_name', 'job_id', 'job_title', and 'min_salary'.
-Return the employee's current information for the columns 'employee_id', and 'department_name'.
-Return the employee's past information for the columns 'job_id', 'job_title', and 'min_salary'.
-Return the output ordered by employee_id and min_salary in ascending order.

Approach : 
- Join employee table with department to get the emp-dep info .
- JOIN employee table with job_history on commom key i.e. emp_id to get the info of emp and their past job histories .
- JOIN job table with job history to get the info of job titles and their min salary.
- Filter job title using LIKE clause to partia match of jobs where emp have any past job related to sales and min salary should be greater than 6000. 
- Retrieve the req info of emp who have past job related to sales and min salary  6k .


Solution : 

SELECT  e.employee_id, d.department_name , jh.job_id, j.job_title , j.min_salary 
FROM employees e 
JOIN departments d 
ON e.department_id = d.department_id
JOIN job_history jh 
ON jh.employee_id = e.employee_id
JOIN jobs j 
ON j.job_id = jh.job_id
WHERE LOWER(j.job_title ) LIKE '%sales%' AND min_salary >= 6000
ORDER BY e.employee_id, min_salary;
