Problem Statement:
Write an SQL query to find all pairs of elements that can form a bond, where one element is classified as a Metal and the other as a Nonmetal.

Result:
-Return the result table with the columns metal and nonmetal, where metal is the name of the metal element and nonmetal is the name of the nonmetal element.
-The output should be ordered by the metal and nonmetal columns in ascending order.

| Sample Input                    | Sample Output         |
|--------------------------       |---------------------- |
| symbol | type     | electron    | metal | nonmetal      |
|--------|----------|------       |-------|---------------|
| He     | Noble    | 0           | Ca    | Cl            |
| Na     | Metal    | 1           | Ca    | N             |
| Ca     | Metal    | 2           | Ca    | O             |
| La     | Metal    | 3           | La    | Cl            |
| Cl     | Nonmetal | 1           | La    | N             |
| O      | Nonmetal | 2           | La    | O             |
| N      | Nonmetal | 3           | Na    | Cl            |



Solution : 

SELECT m.symbol AS metal, n.symbol AS  nonmetal
FROM (SELECT symbol 
FROM elements 
WHERE type = 'Metal') m 
JOIN
(   SELECT symbol
    from elements
    WHERE type = 'Nonmetal'
) n 
ORDER  BY metal, nonmetal;
