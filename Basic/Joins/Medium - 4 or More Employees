Problem Statement:
You need to write a SQL query to find the "full_name" (first_name and last_name, separated by space) of managers who oversee four or more employees.

-The result should be ordered by full_name, lexicographically.
-The column manager_id in the employees table represents the employee_id of the manager.

Approach : 
- Manager is also an employee as well. 
- To perform join in the same table to retrieve manager info , perform SELF JOIN. 
- join on the basis of e's managerId to m's employeeId , so in the m table , there should be manager info .
- retrieve manager first name and last name and concatenate them and then do group by and count how many rows they have . 
- Filter if rows are greater than 4 or more. 
- That means manager who oversee atleast 4 employees .

Solution : 

SELECT CONCAT(m.first_name , ' ', m.last_name) AS full_name
FROM employees e 
INNER JOIN employees m 
ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id 
GROUP BY full_name
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 4
ORDER BY 1;
