Problem Statement:
Write a SQL query to report the IDs of all the employees whose information is missing.

The information of an employee is missing if:
-The employee's name is missing, or
-The employee's salary is missing.
Result:
Return the result table ordered by employee_id in ascending order.
-- A variation of a problem discussed in Scaler.

|     employees |              |              |    salaries   |          |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------- | -------- |
| employee_id   | name         |              | employee_id   | salary   |
| ------------- | ------------ | ---          | ------------- | -------- |
| 2             | Crew         |              | 5             | 76071    |
| 4             | Haven        |              | 1             | 22517    |
| 5             | Kristian     |              | 4             | 63539    |

-Employees 1, 2, 4, and 5 are working at this company.
-The name of employee 1 is missing.
-The salary of employee 2 is missing.

Approach : 
- Final Create CTE of the full join using UNION of left and right join of the table employee and salary.
- Filter where the emp name is null or salary is null. 
- Sort the result using ORDER clause by emp id. 

Solution : 

WITH final AS (
    (SELECT e.employee_id , name , salary
    FROM employees e 
    LEFT  JOIN salaries s 
    ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id)
    UNION 
    (SELECT s.employee_id, name , salary 
    FROM employees e 
    RIGHT JOIN salaries s 
    ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id)
)
SELECT employee_id 
FROM final 
WHERE name IS NULL OR salary IS NULL 
ORDER BY employee_id;
