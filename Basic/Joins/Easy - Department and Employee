Problem Statement:
Write a query to find all departments and respective employee's details, including those departments even if there are no employees assigned to them.

Result:
-Return the columns 'employee_id', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'department_name', and 'department_id' of the employees belonging to that department.
-Return the output ordered by employee_id, department_id, and first_name in ascending order.

-- I came across a similar problem on Scaler!

Approach : 
- We have to retain department table whether an emp assigned to that dep or not .
- for this , keep dep on right and perform right join on it .

Solution : 

SELECT e.employee_id , e.first_name , e.last_name , d.department_id  ,d.department_name 
FROM employees  e 
RIGHT JOIN departments d 
ON e.department_id = d.department_id
ORDER BY e.employee_id, d.department_id, e.first_name;
