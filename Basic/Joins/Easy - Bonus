Problem Statement:
Write a query to report the name and bonus amount of each employee who gets a bonus of less than 1000 and an employee who does not receive any bonus at all.

Result:
-Return the bonus as 'NULL' if an employee doesnâ€™t get a bonus.
-Return the columns 'name' and 'bonus'
-Return the output ordered by the bonus in ascending order.

| employee                  |                                                            |  bonus                  |     |
| ------------------------- | --------------                                             | ----------------------- | --- |
| `empId`                   | INT                                                        | `empId`                 | INT |
| `name`                    | VARCHAR                                                    | `bonus`                 | INT |
| `supervisor`              | INT (nullable) 
| `salary`                  | INT            

Approach : 
- First we have to retain the emp table because whether an emp receive bonus or not , doesnt matter.
- Keep employee on left and do left join .
- filter where bonus less than 1000 and those emp whose bonus is null

Solution : 

SELECT name, bonus
FROM employee e 
LEFT JOIN bonus b 
ON e.empId = b.empId
WHERE bonus < 1000 or bonus IS NULL
ORDER BY bonus;
