Problem : 
Here's what we need to find:

--We are interested in employees working in the 'Administration', 'Marketing', and 'Human Resources' departments.
--For each qualifying employee, we want to retrieve the employee_id, full_name (first and last name separated by space), and salary.
--We want the final results to be ordered by employee_id in ascending order for easier reference.

| Employees           | Type    |   | Departments           | Type    |
| ------------------- | ------- | - | --------------------- | ------- |
| employee_id         | INTEGER |   | department_id         | INTEGER |
| first_name          | VARCHAR |   | department_name       | VARCHAR |
| last_name           | VARCHAR |   | manager_id            | INTEGER |
| email               | VARCHAR |   | location_id           | INTEGER |
| phone_number        | VARCHAR |   |                       |         |
| hire_date           | DATE    |   |                       |         |
| job_id              | VARCHAR |   |                       |         |
| salary              | DECIMAL |   |                       |         |
| commission_pct      | DECIMAL |   |                       |         |
| manager_id          | INTEGER |   |                       |         |
| department_id       | INTEGER |   |                       |         |

-- Modeled after a learning example from Scaler.

Approach : 
- We have the department id in employees table , so we dont know that which department id is assigned to which department.
- For this scenario , Join two tables on the common column (department id).
- Now afetr join , we have table where we have department name as well along with their id . 
- Filter out more than 1 condition in same column (department names ) so we use IN keyword. 
- Sort the output .

Solution :

SELECT e.employee_id , CONCAT(first_name , ' ', last_name) AS full_name , salary
FROM employees e 
JOIN departments d 
ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE department_name IN ('Administration', 'Marketing',  'Human Resources') 
ORDER BY e.employee_id;
