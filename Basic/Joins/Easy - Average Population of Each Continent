-- This query is based on a problem from HackerRank's SQL domain.

Approach : 
- Join both tables on common key to find out the name of continents and in respect to continent , find out the avg population of city and continent is available in the country table.

Solution : 
SELECT ct.continent AS continent_name , FLOOR(AVG(c.population)) AS avg_population 
FROM city c 
JOIN country ct 
ON c.countrycode = ct.code 
GROUP BY ct.continent;
