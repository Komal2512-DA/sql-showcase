Problem : 
Write an SQL query to retrieve a list of distinct city names from the STATION table where the city name ends with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u, case-insensitive).
Ensure that the output contains no duplicate city names. The order of the results does not matter.

Approach : 
There can be a multiple approach for this query : 
- 1 . Using RIGHT clause to get the last character using 1 parameter and then match with vowels . 
- 2 . LIKE clause use to match the partial characters i.e. '%a' 
- 3 . Using REGEX , [char]$ let you to match the characters defined in the square brackets at the end .

SELECT DISTINCT city 
FROM station 
WHERE city REGEXP'[aeiouAEIOU]$';
