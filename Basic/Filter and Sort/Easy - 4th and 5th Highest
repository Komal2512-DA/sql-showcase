Approach : 
- Select the required column name . 
- sort the output on the basis of salary in desc order to find out the highest salaried employee.
- We need to find out the 4th and 5th highest salaried employee. 
- For this , use limit to retrieve only required number of rows . 
- Use offset to skip the rows , whichever is not required .

Solution : 
SELECT employee_number, first_name, last_name,  salary
FROM employees 
ORDER BY salary DESC 
LIMIT 2 
OFFSET 3;
