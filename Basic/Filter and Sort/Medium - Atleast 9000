Problem Statement:
Write a SQl query to display the details of those departments where the salary of each employee in that department is at least 9000.

- Return all the columns from the departments table.
- Return the result ordered by department_id in ascending order.

-- Got the idea from a Scaler session.

Approach :
- SELECT * retrieve all the info of department table .
- Filter department ids which have employee whose min salary >= 9000 which means all the emp of that department have salary greater than 9000 if their min salary is 9000.
- Using IN because there are multiple departments which have employee where all the emp have salary more than 9000.
  So, any one of them exists will return that department.

Alternate Approach : 
- We have to find out the department whose all the emp have salary greater than 9000 .
- For this scenrio , we will use NOT EXISTS .
- Why NOT EXISTS ?? 
  Because if we use EXISTS and return that department whose emp salary is greater than 9000 , then it will return that department in that whether an another employee
  have salary less than 9000 and we are nt looking for consider only of 1 emp. So use NOT EXISTS which founds if any emp have salary less than 9000 , then will not return that department.
- Co-relate the department to the inner query , so it will finds out for the same department which is outside.

Solution : 

SELECT *
FROM departments 
WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id
                        FROM employees 
                        GROUP BY department_id
                        HAVING MIN(salary) >= 9000)
ORDER BY 1;

Alternate Way : 

SELECT d.*
FROM departments d 
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM employees e 
    WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id AND e.salary < 9000
) AND d.manager_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY d.department_id;
