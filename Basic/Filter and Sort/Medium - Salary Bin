Problem Statement:
The goal is to write an SQL query to divide employees into three salary classes based on specified salary ranges and create a new column Salary_bin that indicates the class.

- Salary greater than 20,000 (i.e, excluding 20,000) as 'Class A'
- Salary between 10,000 to 20,000 (i.e, including both 10,000 and 20,000) as 'Class B'
- Salary less than 10,000 (i.e, excluding 10,000) as 'Class C'.
The results should include the columns employee_id, salary, and Salary_bin, ordered by employee_id in ascending order for easier reference.
-- The idea for this problem comes from Scaler.

Approach : 
- Create new column using CASE ...WHEN ... THEN ... END statement when you have multiple conditions . 
- Sort the output as according to the position in the SELECT clause. 

Solution : 
SELECT employee_id , salary , 
    CASE 
        WHEN salary < 10000 THEN 'Class C'
        WHEN salary BETWEEN 10000 AND 20000 THEN 'Class B'
        WHEN salary > 20000 THEN 'Class A'
    END AS Salary_bin
FROM employees
ORDER BY 1;
