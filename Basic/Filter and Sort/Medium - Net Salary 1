Problem Statement:
Write a query to calculate the net salary for the employees and save the column as 'Net_Salary' and display the details of those employees whose net salary is greater than 15000.

Use the CTE method.
Note: To calculate the 'Net_Salary' = salary + salary *(commission_pct).
If the column 'comission_pct' consists of null values replace them with zeros.
Result:
-Return the columns 'employee_id', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'salary', and 'Net_Salary'.
-Return the result ordered by employee_id in ascending order.

| employees Table     | Data Type     | 
| ------------------- | ------------- |
| employee_id         | INTEGER       | 
| first_name          | VARCHAR(20)   | 
| last_name           | VARCHAR(25)   | 
| email               | VARCHAR(25)   | 
| phone_number        | VARCHAR(20)   |  
| hire_date           | DATE          |
| job_id              | VARCHAR(10)   | 
| salary              | INTEGER       |  
| commission_pct      | DECIMAL(3,2)  |  
| manager_id          | INTEGER       |  
| department_id       | INTEGER       | 

Approach : 
- Using the CTE method, select the columns employee_id, first_name, last_name, and salary from the employee’s table.
- If the column ‘comission_pct’ consists of null values replace them with zeros using the ifnull() function.
- Calculate Net Salary. 
- In the outer query, select all the columns from the inner query, and in the where clause use the ‘>’ operator to filter the records whose net salary is greater than 15000.

Solution : 

WITH final AS (
    SELECT employee_id , first_name , last_name , salary , salary + salary* IFNULL(commission_pct, 0) as Net_Salary
    FROM employees 
)
SELECT *
FROM final 
WHERE Net_Salary > 15000
ORDER BY employee_id;
