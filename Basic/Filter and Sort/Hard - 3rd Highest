Problem Statement:
Write a SQL query to find all the details of employees who earn the third-highest salary.

- Return all the columns from the employees table.
- Avoid using the LIMIT keyword in the query.

-- This mirrors competitive questions used in Scaler mocks.

Approach : 
- Motive is to find out third highest salaried employee info without using LIMIT. 
- First find out the max salary which is the first_max_salary as a inner query.
- Inner most query return the max salary and filter out the salary which is less than that salary and retrieve the max salary of it . 
- Repeat the process to find out which onee is the third highest salary . 
- Once you get the third highest salary , use it as filter in WHERE clause to get the info of that employee which salary should be equal to the third highest salary. 

Solution : 

SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) AS third_max
                FROM employees
                WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) AS sec_max
                                FROM employees
                                WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) AS first_max
                                                FROM employees )));
