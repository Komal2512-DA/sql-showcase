Problem : 
Write a query to return a list of all employees with selected last names: King, Taylor, and Grant from the employee's table.

Result:
-Return all the fields.
-Return the result ordered by employee_id in ascending order.

This problem is based on a concept from Scaler.

Approach :
- To retrieve all the columns , use SELECT * . 
- Filter using WHERE clause and there are more than 1 condition in the same column , so use IN clause .
- Sort the output by mentioned column  .

Solution : 
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE Last_name IN ('King', 'Taylor', 'Grant')
ORDER BY employee_id ;
