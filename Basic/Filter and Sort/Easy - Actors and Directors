Problem Statement:
Write a query to generate a report that lists pairs of actor_id and director_id where the actor has collaborated with the director at least three times.
The resultant table should be ordered by actor_id in ascending manner.

actordirector
Sample Input : 
| actor_id  | director_id  | timestamp |
| --------- | ------------ | --------- |
| 1         | 1            | 0         |
| 1         | 1            | 1         |
| 1         | 1            | 2         |
| 1         | 2            | 3         |
| 1         | 2            | 4         |
| 2         | 1            | 5         |
| 2         | 1            | 6         |

Sample Output : The only pair where the actor & director is collaborated exactly 3 times is (1, 1).
- Inspired by Scaler.

Approach :
- First step is to Group by actor_id and director_id to find out the count of rows using HAVING clause which should be atleast 3 or greater than 3 . 
- Filter using Having clause becaz count of row is not a part of table .
- This query returns the combo of actor and director who generate reports as pairs atleast 3 times.

Solution : 
SELECT actor_id , director_id 
FROM actordirector
GROUP BY actor_id , director_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3 
ORDER BY 1;
