Problem : 
Write a query to get all the details of all the employees from job_history except for the employee with ID 101.

Derived from a Scaler exercise.

Approach : 
- To filter which should not be equal to , we use <> or !=.

Solution : 

SELECT *
FROM job_history 
WHERE employee_id <> 101
ORDER BY employee_id, job_id ;

Alternate Way : 
SELECT *
FROM job_history 
WHERE employee_id != 101
ORDER BY employee_id, job_id ;
