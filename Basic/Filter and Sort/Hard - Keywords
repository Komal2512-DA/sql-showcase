Problem : 
Write a query to list down all the movies along with their details that have keywords like 'sport' or 'sequel' or 'suspense'.

Result:
-Return the columns 'original_title', 'director', 'genres', 'cast', 'budget', 'revenue', 'runtime', and 'vote_average'.
-Return the columns ordered by original_title in ascending order.

This question is adapted from a Scaler problem.

Approach : 
- Mention the required column in the SELECT clause . 
- To filter using WHERE clause , we need to filter out partial match .
- LIKE clause used to filter the partial match .
- To filter out those records which contains keyword mentioned , for this , we have to do Lower of that column and checks that any keyword contains mentioned word or not.
- LIKE "%word%".

Solution : 

SELECT original_title , director , genres , cast , budget , revenue, runtime ,vote_average
FROM movies 
WHERE LOWER(keywords) LIKE '%sport%' OR LOWER(keywords) LIKE '%sequel%' OR LOWER(keywords) LIKE '%suspense%'
ORDER BY original_title;
