Problem Description:
Given a list of candidates and their skills, write a SQL query to find the candidates who possess all three required skills for the Data Science position.
Specifically, you are looking for candidates who are proficient in 'Python', 'Tableau', and 'MySQL'.

-Note that there are no duplicates in the candidates table.
-Return the result ordered by candidate_id in ascending order.

candidates 
| candidate_id  | skill   |
| ------------- | ------- |
| 100           | Python  |
| 100           | Tableau |
| 100           | MySQL   |
| 101           | R       |
| 101           | Tableau |
| 101           | Java    |
| 102           | PowerBi |
| 102           | MySQL   |

Output : Candidate 100 is displayed because he/she possesses all three required skills: Python, Tableau, and MySQL. Candidates 101 and 102 are not included in the output because they are missing one or more of the required skills.
-- This problem is inspired by Scaler

Approach : 
- To find out candidates whose skills are 3 , we have to group by and filter on the count of candidate.
- Then filter skills which should be specified skills mentioned in the ques in WHERE clause .
- WHY WHERE clause ?
  to filter on the column which was present in the table.
- WHY HAVING clause on count of skills ?
  to filter on the column which is not a part of table .

Solution : 

SELECT DISTINCT candidate_id 
FROM candidates
WHERE skill IN ("Python", "Tableau", "MySQL")
GROUP BY candidate_id
HAVING COUNT(skill) = 3
ORDER BY candidate_id;
