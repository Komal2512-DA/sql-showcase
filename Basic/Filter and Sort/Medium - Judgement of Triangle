Problem Statement:
Write a SQL query to report whether each triad of the three line segments in the given data can form a triangle or not.

Note: The resultant table should be ordered by x, y and z respectively, in ascending order.
-- This question is inspired from Scaler .

Approach : 
- We know sum of two should be greater than third one , replace it by every side , if one of them not satisfied , then it is not a trianlge.
- Use CASE WHEN to meet conditions, if yes then return yes else no.
- x + y > z AND y + z > x AND z + x > y, all should be true to be a triangle.

Solution : 
SELECT *, 
    CASE 
        WHEN x + y > z AND y + z > x AND z + x > y THEN 'Yes'
        ELSE 'No' 
    END AS triangle
FROM triangle
ORDER BY x , y , z;
