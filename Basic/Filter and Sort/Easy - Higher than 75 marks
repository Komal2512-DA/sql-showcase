Problem : 
Select the names of students from the STUDENTS table who have achieved a score greater than 75. Sort the result set by the final three characters of each student's name. In cases where multiple names share the same three-letter suffix, use the student ID as a secondary sorting key in ascending order.

+--------+--------+
| Column | Type   |
+--------+--------+
| ID     | Integer|
| Name   | String |
| Marks  | Integer|
+--------+--------+
The Name column only contains uppercase (A-Z) and lowercase (a-z) letters.
-- This problem statement is inspired from Hackerrank .

Approach : 
- Find students whose marks scored higher than 75 by using WHERE clause.
- From those students, retrieve their names.
- Sort the names by their last three characters.
- If multiple names share the same ending, order them by ID in increasing order and if you dont mention type of sort , then the default sort is ASC.


Solution : 
SELECT name 
FROM students 
WHERE marks > 75
ORDER BY RIGHT(name, 3), id ;
