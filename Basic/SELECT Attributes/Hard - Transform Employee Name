Problem : 
Write a query to transform and display the Full Name (first_name and last_name separated by space) of all employees where only the first letter of the Full Name is capital.

Result:
Return the result ordered by employee_number in ascending order.

- This problem is inspired by Scaler 

Approach : 
- We use concat clause to concat two columns (first_name , last_name). 
- for concatenating it into proper form , we have to first use substr clause to extract letter from to position to length from position .
- SUBSTR( col_name, position , length from position).
- Transform to upper and lower as it is required by sub- parting the word . 
- Order by using position of col_name in select clause.

Solution : 
SELECT employee_number , CONCAT(UPPER(SUBSTR(first_name, 1, 1)), LOWER(SUBSTR(first_name, 2)), " ", LOWER(last_name)) AS "Full Name"
FROM employees
ORDER BY 1;
