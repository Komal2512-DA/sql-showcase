Problem : 
You're working with a table named STATION that stores information about various cities, including their geographical coordinates.

Using this data, you need to compute the Euclidean Distance between two points 
P1(a,c) and P2(b,d) defined as:

ùëé : the minimum value of LAT_N (northern latitude)
ùëè : the maximum value of LAT_N
ùëê : the minimum value of LONG_W (western longitude)
ùëë : the maximum value of LONG_W

The Euclidean Distance is calculated using the formula:
         SQUARE ROOT of ( (a-b)^2 + (c-d)^2 )  
Round the result to 4 decimal places.

Approach : 
- Use MAX() and MIN() to find the value of lat_n and long_w .
- Then find the difference between min and max of lat_n and min and max of long_w .
- Then use POWER(-----, 2) on both of diffrence values . 
- Add both values returned by Power of difference of min and max of lat_n and long_w.
- At the end , ROUND(---, 4) to round off the decimal value till 4 points.

Solution : 
SELECT ROUND(SQRT( POWER(MIN(lat_n) -  MAX(lat_n),2) + POWER(MIN(long_w) - MAX(long_w),2) ), 4)
FROM station ;
