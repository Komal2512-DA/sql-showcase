Problem : 
You're given a table named STATION, which stores geographical data about various stations, including their latitudes and longitudes.

From this table, you need to calculate the Manhattan Distance between two points 
𝑃1(𝑎,𝑏) and 𝑃2(𝑐,𝑑) where:
𝑎 : a is the minimum value of LAT_N (northern latitude)
𝑏 : b is the minimum value of LONG_W (western longitude)
𝑐 : c is the maximum value of LAT_N
𝑑 : d is the maximum value of LONG_W

The Manhattan Distance between 
𝑃1 and 𝑃2 is calculated as:
          ∣a−c∣ + ∣b−d∣
Round the final result to 4 decimal places.

Approach : 
- use ABS() to make sure the value should be positive and find the difference if a and c , then b and d .
- Then add both of them and round them till 4 decimal points using ROUND( ----, 4).


Solution : 
SELECT ROUND(abs(MAX(lat_n) - MIN(lat_n)) + abs(MAX(long_w)-MIN(long_w)), 4)
FROM station ;
