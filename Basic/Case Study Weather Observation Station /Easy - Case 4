Problem : 

Write an SQL query to find the difference between:
- The total number of city entries in the CITY column (including duplicates), and
- The number of distinct city names in the CITY column (excluding duplicates).

Station table Contain ID AS int, city AS Varchar(21) , state Varchar(20), lat_n INT , long_w INT where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.
This problem statement derieved from HackerRank .

Aprroach : 
- First step to calculate the count of total cities .
- Second step to calculate the count of unique cities.
- Then find out the difference between both of them and because of not executing 2 queries separately , so we perform this calculation inside a subquery.

Solution : 
SELECT(
    (SELECT COUNT(city) FROM Station) - (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT city) FROM station)
);
