Hereâ€™s a HackerRank-style problem statement for your query:

Problem Statement:
Write an SQL query to find the sum of the LAT_N values from the STATION table where LAT_N is greater than 38.7880 and less than 137.2345.
Your result should be truncated to 4 decimal places.

Approach : 
Use Truncate that means to cut off the number after a certain number of decimal places without rounding.
Filter the values using WHERE clause . 
Finally, use an alias to assign a temporary name to the rounded result for clarity in the output.

Solution : 
SELECT TRUNCATE(SUM(lat_n), 4 ) AS total_lat_n
FROM station 
WHERE lat_n > 38.7880 and lat_n < 137.2345;
