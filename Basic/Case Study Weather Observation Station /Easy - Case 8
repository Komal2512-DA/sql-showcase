Problem : 
Write an SQL query to retrieve a list of distinct city names from the STATION table where the city name starts and ends with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u, case-insensitive).
-- This problem statement inspired from HackerRank

Approach : 
Using REGEX , combine the both both scenerios together to match the pattern at start and end as well i.e. ^[char].*[char]$

Solution : 

SELECT DISTINCT city 
FROM station 
WHERE city REGEXP'^[aeiouAEIOU].*[aeiouAEIOU]$';
