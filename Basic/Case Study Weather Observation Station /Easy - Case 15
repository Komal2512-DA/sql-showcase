Problem Statement:
Write an SQL query to find the Western Longitude (LONG_W) corresponding to the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) from the STATION table where LAT_N is less than 137.2345.
Round the result to 4 decimal places.
-- This exercise is adapted from a HackerRank challenge.

Approach : 
-First, round the LONG_W value from the STATION table where the LAT_N is the highest possible value less than 137.2345.
-SQL does not allow the use of aggregate functions (like MAX) directly in the WHERE clause. Therefore, to filter the maximum latitude, use a subquery that returns the maximum LAT_N less than 137.2345.
-Then, use this subquery result in your outer query's WHERE clause to retrieve the corresponding LONG_W.
-Finally, apply the ROUND function to truncate the LONG_W value to 4 decimal places.

Solution : 
SELECT ROUND(long_w, 4) AS long_w
FROM station 
WHERE lat_n = (
    SELECT MAX(lat_n) AS max_latn
    FROM station 
    WHERE lat_n < 137.2345
) ;
