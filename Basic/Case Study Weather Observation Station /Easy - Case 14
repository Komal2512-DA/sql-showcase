Problem Statement:
Write an SQL query to find the greatest value of LAT_N from the STATION table where LAT_N is less than 137.2345.
Your result should be truncated to 4 decimal places.
-- This exercise is adapted from a HackerRank challenge.

Approach : 
Use Truncate that means to cut off the number after a certain number of decimal places without rounding.
Filter the values using WHERE clause . 
Finally, use an alias to assign a temporary name to the rounded result for clarity in the output.

Solution : 
SELECT TRUNCATE(MAX(lat_n), 4) AS max_lat_n
FROM station 
WHERE lat_n < 137.2345;
