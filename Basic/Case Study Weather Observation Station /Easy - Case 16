Problem Statement:
Query the STATION table to find the minimum value of LAT_N where it is strictly greater than 38.7780.
The result should be rounded to 4 decimal places.
-- This problem is adapted from a HackerRank SQL challenge.

Approach : 
Use MIN aggregated function to find the minimum value of northern latitude which is less than 38.7780 and filter the value by using WHERE clause Finally, apply the ROUND function.  

Solution : 
SELECT ROUND(MIN(lat_n), 4) AS lat_n 
FROM station 
WHERE lat_n > 38.7780;
