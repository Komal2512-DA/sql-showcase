Problem : 
Write an SQL query to retrieve a list of distinct city names from the STATION table where the city name does not end with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u, case-insensitive).
-- This problem inspired from HackerRank 

Approach : 
In REGEX , using caret inside the sqaure brackets represents that the characters should not match .

Solution : 
SELECT DISTINCT city 
FROM station 
WHERE city REGEXP'[^aeiouAEIOU]$';
