Problem : 
Write an SQL query to retrieve a list of distinct city names from the STATION table where the city name either does not start with a vowel or does not end with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u, case-insensitive).
This exercise is adapted from a HackerRank challenge.

Approach : 
- to get the unique city , use DISTINCT clause 
- to match the patterns , use REGEX , caret inside square bracket represents , it should not match and caret outside square bracket means match pattern with the starting character and dollar outside sqaure bracket means match the pattern with the last character 

Solution : 
SELECT DISTINCT city 
FROM station 
WHERE city REGEXP'^[^aeiou]' OR city REGEXP'[^aeiou]$';
