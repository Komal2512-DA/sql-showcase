Problem Statement:
Write a query to determine the quality and poor query percentage for each search query.

- Query Quality: The average of the ratio between the query rating and its position.
- Poor Query Percentage: The percentage of all queries with a rating less than 3.

Note:
- Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
- Return the result ordered by query_name, lexicographically.

Dog queries
quality is ((5 / 1) + (5 / 2) + (1 / 200)) / 3 = 2.50
poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33
Cat queries
quality equals ((2 / 5) + (3 / 3) + (4 / 7)) / 3 = 0.66
poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33

-- I came across a similar problem on Scaler!

Approach : 
- In the SELECT clause , we have to find out the quality and poor query percentage .
- For quality , we have to find out first ratio by rating/position , then find out AVG of it after group by the data on query name.
- For poor query percentage , we can't filter using WHERE clause because it will filter out for quality column as well which is not good for quality column.
- For this scenario , we will use IF condition , where if rating is less than 3 , it return 1 else 0 and finds the average of it .
- Round both columns effectively upto 2 decimal points.

Solution : 

SELECT query_name , ROUND(AVG(rating/position), 2) AS quality, 
        ROUND(AVG(IF(rating < 3, 1, 0) ) * 100, 2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM queries 
GROUP BY query_name
ORDER BY query_name;
