Problem Statement:
A single number is a number that appeared only once in the mynumbers table.

In our data analysis, we are interested in identifying unique values within the mynumbers table. 
Specifically, we need to determine the largest single number that appears only once in this table. 
If no such unique value exists, the result should be null.

Write a SQL query to perform the above-mentioned task.

mynumbers : 8 8 3 3 1 4 5 6 , output : 6

--Try this challenge influenced by Scalerâ€™s problem sets.

Approach : 
- To find  out the max number whose count is equal to 1 , then group the num column and to filter the out the data which is not a part of table , use HAVING clause.
- Use case when else end statement , for the scenario where count of num is not equal to 1 then output should be null else max of num .

Solution : 

SELECT CASE 
          WHEN COUNT(num) != 1 THEN null 
          ELSE MAX(num) 
       END AS num
FROM mynumbers 
GROUP BY num
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1;
