Problem Statement:
Write a query to find the shortest distance between any two points from the points table.
The distance should be calculated using the Euclidean distance formula and rounded to two decimal points. Save the result in a new column named 'shortest'.
Result:
Return the column shortest which contains the shortest distance between any two points, rounded to two decimal points.
-- Inspired by questions seen in Scaler interviews.

points 
| x | INT|
| y | INT|

Approach : 
- Inner query will return the possible combinations of x and y where either x should be equal to x or y should not be equal to y .
- From this scenario , we know the formula of Euclidean Distance sqrt(power^2(x2-x1) + power^2(y2-y1)).
- Apply this formula and find out the min of them .

Solution :

SELECT MIN(ROUND(SQRT(POW((x2-x1), 2) + POW((y2-y1), 2)), 2)) AS shortest
FROM
(SELECT p1.x AS x1 , p1.y AS y1, p2.x AS x2, p2.y AS y2
FROM points p1 
JOIN points p2 
ON p1.x != p2.x OR p1.y != p2.y) s;
