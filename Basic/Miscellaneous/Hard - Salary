Problem Statement:
Write a query to display the employee's full name (first name and last name separated by space) as 'full_name' of all those employees whose salary is greater than 40% of their department’s total salary or employees who don't belong to any department.

Result:
-Return the column 'full_name'.
-Return the output ordered by full_name in ascending order.
-- This mirrors competitive questions used in Scaler mocks.

Approach : 
-You're selecting first_name + last_name as full_name from employees table.
-subquery Joins employees and departments on department_id. Filters to only include employees from the same department as the current employee in the outer query (e1.department_id).
-Computes the sum of salaries in that department. Then multiplies that sum by 0.4 to get 40% of total salary for the department.
-If salary > 40% of department total → include. Also include employees with NULL department.

Solution : 

SELECT CONCAT(first_name , ' ', last_name) AS full_name
FROM employees e1
WHERE salary > (SELECT 0.4*SUM(salary)
                FROM employees e 
                JOIN departments d 
                ON e.department_id = d.department_id
                WHERE d.department_id = e1.department_id
                GROUP BY e.department_id) OR department_id IS NULL
ORDER BY 1;
