Problem Statement :
You are given a table named OCCUPATIONS that stores the names of people along with their professions.
      Occupations
| Column     | Type   |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Name       | String |
| Occupation | String |

The Occupation column will contain one of the following values only: Doctor, Professor, Singer, or Actor.

You are required to write SQL queries to generate two result sets:
1. Alphabetically Sorted List with Profession Initials
List all names from the OCCUPATIONS table in alphabetical order, appending the first letter of the profession in parentheses immediately after the name.
Example output format: AnActorName(A) , ADoctorName(D) , AProfessorName(P) , ASingerName(S)

2. Count of Each Occupation
Count how many times each profession appears in the table and print it in the format:
             There are a total of [count] [occupation]s.
 - Use the lowercase form of each occupation.
 - Sort the results by the count in ascending order.
 - If two occupations have the same count, sort them alphabetically.

Sample Input : 
| Name      | Occupation |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Aamina    | Doctor     |
| Ashley    | Professor  |
| Belvet    | Professor  |
| Britney   | Professor  |
| Christeen | Singer     |
| Eve       | Actor      |
| Jane      | Singer     |
| Jennifer  | Actor      |
| Jenny     | Singer     |
| Julia     | Doctor     |
| Ketty     | Actor      |
| Kristeen  | Singer     |
| Maria     | Professor  |
| Meera     | Professor  |
| Naomi     | Professor  |
| Priya     | Doctor     |
| Priyanka  | Professor  |
| Samantha  | Actor      |

Approach : 
- For the execution of first query , we required to concat the name with the first alphabet of their profession enclosed in paranthesis. 
- Use CONCAT() as accordingly how I required to concat and for getting the first char from occupation, we use LEFT(----, 1).
- Once , names are concatenate in respect to their profession and order them by name . 
- For the execution of second query , we required to concat the statement in which mention the count of occupation and occupation name . 
- Use CONCAT() as accordingly .
- We use COUNT() to count the occupation , for that we have to first group the occupation for getting the count in respect to their occupation . 
- Once info concatenated , sort the info by count of occupation , and if there are more than same count of occupation , then sort them by occupation  name , for this use ORDER BY clause.

Solution : 
SELECT CONCAT(name, '(', LEFT(occupation, 1), ')') AS name
FROM occupations
ORDER BY name ;
SELECT CONCAT('There are a total of ', COUNT(occupation), ' ', LOWER(occupation), 's.') 
FROM occupations 
GROUP BY occupation
ORDER BY COUNT(occupation), occupation;
