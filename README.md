## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My SQL Portfolio

Hi there! I'm Komal, and this is my personal SQL portfolio â€” a space where I share my journey and learning experience with SQL.

I've learned and practiced extensively through platforms like **Scaler** and **HackerRank**, solving problems from **basic to intermediate** levels. In my learning journey with Scaler, I had the opportunity to work on real-world case studies using Google BigQuery.
At the same time, I practiced and solved multiple SQL problems on HackerRank, focusing on MySQL.

Thanks to this experience, Iâ€™ve developed hands-on knowledge and confidence working with both **BigQuery** and **MySQL** â€” two of the most in-demand platforms in data analytics today. ðŸ’ª

I'm excited to keep learning and sharing more! ðŸ“ˆ
