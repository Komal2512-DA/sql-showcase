Problem Statement:
You have been asked to display the details of employees who have been working in the company for at least 28 years as of June 8, 2022.
This involves calculating the total number of years (Total_years) each employee has been with the company and identifying those who meet or exceed the 28-year threshold.

-The result should include the columns employee_id, first_name, last_name, and the Total_years they've worked with us.
-The result should be ordered by employee_id in ascending order for clarity and ease of reference.
Note:
-To get the Total_years, calculate the difference in days between the hire date and June 8, 2022.
-Then, convert this difference into years by dividing by 365.
-Don't forget to round the total years up to two decimal points.
-- This question is adapted from a Scaler problem.

Approach : 
-Select the columns employee_id, first_name, last_name, and hire_date from the employee’s table.
-Use the datediff() function between the given date and hire_date column and divide the difference by 365 to extract the total working years of the employees. Save the column as "Total_years".
-In the where clause apply the same computation for Total_years and filter the records using the ‘>=’ operator of those employees who has been working for atleast 28 years.

Solution : 

SELECT employee_id , first_name , last_name , ROUND(DATEDIFF('2022-06-08', hire_date)/365, 2) AS Total_years
FROM employees
WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, hire_date, '2022-06-08') >= 28
ORDER BY employee_id;
