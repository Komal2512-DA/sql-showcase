Problem Statement:
You are tasked with extracting critical data from the Human Resource database of your current company in order to support year-end financial analysis.

Write an SQL query to retrieve the following information:
-employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary, hire_date, along with the columns Day, Month, and Year extracted from the employee's hire_date.
-Filter the data to include only employees hired in January 2000 and earning salaries greater than $5000.
-The results should be sorted by employee_id in ascending order to facilitate comprehensive review and performance evaluation.
-- The idea for this problem comes from Scaler.

Approach : 
- Select the columns employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary, and hire_date from the employeeâ€™s table.
- Use the extract() function on the hire_date column. 
  You can either use EXTRACT() OR [DAY() , YEAR(), MONTH() ] upto all on you. 
- Filter out the year and month based on the condition using BETWEEN clause. 
- Sort the record by employee_id .

Solution : 

SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary, hire_date, DAY(hire_date) AS Day, MONTH(hire_date) AS Month, YEAR(hire_date) AS Year
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '2000-01-01' AND '2000-01-31' AND salary > 5000
ORDER BY employee_id ;
