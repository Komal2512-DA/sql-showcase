Problem Statement:
Write a query to display the details of the employees who have the 5th highest salary in each job category.

Result:
-Return the columns 'employee_id', 'first_name', and 'job_id'.
-Return the result ordered by employee_id in ascending order.
-- This follows the thought process encouraged by Scaler.

Approach :
- Select the columns employee_id, first_name, and job_id from the employeeâ€™s table.
- Use the dense_rank() window function to extract employee details who has the fifth-highest salary. In the over() clause use the partition by on the job_id column and order by on the salary column in descending order.
- In the outer query print the employee details (i.e,employee_id,first_name, job_id) and filter the records using the where clause on whose salary rank is 5.
- Use the order by clause to order the data by employee_id in ascending order.

Solution : 

SELECT employee_id, first_name, job_id
FROM 
(SELECT employee_id , first_name , job_id , DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY job_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS drnk
FROM employees) x
WHERE drnk = 5 
ORDER BY 1;
